# JARVIS-Voice-Assistant-System

    ''' bash

    JARVIS is a Python-based voice assistant that can interact with the user through speech recognition, perform tasks like opening applications, searching on Google or Wikipedia, playing music randomly, telling jokes, and having small talk.

    This project uses speech recognition and text-to-speech (TTS) to provide a hands-free assistant experience similar to Iron Man's JARVIS.

## About this project

🚀 Built My Own Voice-Controlled Jarvis Assistant.

Today I’m excited to share a small project I’ve been working on — my own voice-controlled Jarvis assistant, fully built with Python.

It can understand both Bangla & English, respond through TTS, and perform real actions on my laptop.

Simple idea → But, Try to contious learninng!

🔥 Key Features (Explained Simply)

- ✔ Voice Commands — I can talk to Jarvis naturally, and it understands.
- ✔ Bangla + English STT — Detects both languages and auto-translates.
- ✔ Open Apps — VS Code, Terminal, Browser, Files, Calculator, etc.
- ✔ Control Laptop — Adjust brightness, volume, and Wi-Fi.
- ✔ Smart Search — Opens Google, YouTube, Wikipedia instantly.
- ✔ Daily Study Routine — Reads out my study plan on voice command.
- ✔ Jokes, News & Small Talk — For fun and friendly interaction.
- ✔ Fallback AI Response — If no match found, it uses an LLM reply.

This project helped me learn:

🟡 Speech Recognition

🟡 System automation

🟡 Error handling

🟡 Building structured Python modules

🟡 Designing voice-based interaction

Small steps, continous learning.

Grateful to Boktiar Ahmed Bappy and the Inception BD team for their continuous support and guidance.
